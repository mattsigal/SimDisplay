# SimDisplay
R package for the visualization of Monte Carlo Simulation results.

`SimDisplay` is a package useful for the visualization and summarization of complex tabular data. It has been designed to work with objects produced by `SimDesign`, and extends `ggplot2` functionality.
    
`SimDisplay` is still a work in progress so please [file an issue](https://github.com/mattsigal/SimDisplay/issues) if you run into issues or have suggestions for further methods or refinements.

## Installation

```R
# SimDisplay is currently only hosted on GitHub:
